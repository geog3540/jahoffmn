      <div class="row">
         <p class="card-text">The tool SOMVIS was used to visualize the multivariate relationships between 
          animal agriculure and cancer rates in Iowa. SOMVIS clusters the data into groups that are similar 
          across all variables considered. Overall, the similiarity in color of each zip code indicates more
          similar clustering. Three different visualizations are produced using SOMVIS. There is a choropleth
          map where counties are colored based on the cluster they blong to, a parallel coordinates plot which
          shows the values of each variable for each cluster, and self organizing map. The self organizing
          map plots each cluster as circle which is scaled by the number of zip codes in that cluster. The hexagons
          between each cluster are colored based on how close or apart the clusers are, where dark gray or black rrepresent 
          dissimilarity between neighboring clusters, and light gray or white represent similarity. Below is a visualization of 
          all variables considered, which are listed below.

          <strong>Variables used for the SOMVIS Visualization:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Normalized percentages of cattle (Pct_Cattle), swine (Pct_Swine), and chicken (Pct_Chicken) created by dividing the amount of each respective animal in the chosen zip by the total
              of that animal in the state.</li>
            <li>Age adjusted rate of cancer incidence from 2016 - 2020 for Prostate, Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL), Colorectal, and Lung.</li>

          <strong>Cattle and Cancer Incidence</strong><br>
          By removing swine and chicken from the analysis, the relationship between cattle and cancer incidence can be seen.
          The most obvious clusters are those in green shades, mostly in Northwest Iowa which have both high cattle and high
          incidence rates for Colorectal and Prostate.

          <strong>Swine and Cancer Incidence</strong><br>
          By removing cattle and chicken from the analysis, the relationship between swine and cancer incidence can be seen.
          Less obvious clusters are seen, however, Northwest Iowa is still highly clustered. As seen in the point symbol map,
          swine is highly distriubted across the state, with a slightly higher concentration in the Northwest. Due to this,
          clusters are much less distinct.

          By removing cattle and swine from the analysis, the relationship between chicken and cancer incidence can be seen.
          Again, Northwest Iowa is highly clustered, but not with high amounts of chicken. From the clusters, no link between
          chicken and cancer incidence is seen.
